## Overview
This immersive training experience simulates realistic crime scenes for educational use on Meta Quest 3 headsets. Developed in the University of Missouri–Kansas City’s Augmented and Virtual Reality (AVR) Showroom and Computer Lab, this project teaches aspiring journalists how to observe, document, and report from chaotic and sensitive environments like crime scenes.

## Purpose
- Provide communication and journalism students with hands-on, immersive practice
- Provide computer science students with real-world XR development experience
- Develop intuitive VR interaction systems

## Technology
- Unity (C#)
- Meta Quest 3 Hardware

## Team
- Joshua Jackson (Assistant Teaching Professor - UMKC Humanities and Social Sciences)
- J. Sailor Usher (AVR Coordinator - UMKC School of Science and Engineering)
- Robert-Abel Porras (SSE Student Developer)
- Vincent Yang (SSE Student Developer)

## Development Updates

### Update 1 — Pre-Planning Phase (March 31, 2025)
UMKC's Department of Communication and Journalism was interested in hiring students to build an immersive experience for journalism students to practice reporting.
In planning meetings, Joshua Jackson and Sailor Usher laid out the scope of the project, goals, and set an adaptable time-line. 
Here are the core goals:
- teleportation movement
- ability to pick up objects
- crime scene assets

Here are the stretch goals:
- A teleprompter that scrolls through text (we will let the student workers plan the interaction)
  - The ability to select between different scripts
  - An app that runs on a pc that can send scripts to the users in the simulation over TCP/IP
- Any ideas they are inspired to build.

- **Key Considerations:**
  - Focus on realism without being graphic or disturbing.
  - Encourage decision-making and attention to detail.
  - Scene reactivity based on observation and interaction.

Next: Planning and kickoff with Robert-Abel and Vincent.
